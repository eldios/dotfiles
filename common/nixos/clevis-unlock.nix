# Clevis network-bound LUKS auto-unlock (systemd stage 1).
#
# Each host's root LUKS is unlocked at boot by fetching a Shamir-split key
# from the OTHER host's Tang server over the LAN (see [[tang-server.nix]]).
# The per-host JWE (the wrapped keyslot passphrase) lives in the private
# secrets repo, in the clear by design: it is useless without a reachable
# Tang, and the initrd needs it at build time (before sops exists).
#
# Generic: resolves the JWE by hostname and the LUKS device name from the
# host's own initrd.luks config. Self-activates only once the JWE exists in
# the secrets input (no-op before `nix flake update secrets`).
#
# Networking is STATIC in initrd (eno0 reuses br0's static address). DHCP/DNS
# proved too volatile — leases and `.lan` records drift, so the boot couldn't
# reliably reach the peer Tang. The JWE targets are the peers' static IPs.
#
# Fallbacks if Tang is unreachable (blackout, off-network): the Yubikey FIDO2
# keyslots (crypttabExtraOpts below) and the passphrase (keyslot 0) remain.
